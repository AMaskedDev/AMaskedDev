# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm Sproute, a 13-year-old boy from Greece! Welcome to my GitHub :-)

## About Me

- **Programmer:** I love coding and exploring new technologies.
- **Game Dev Hobbyist:** I enjoy creating games when i feel like it, but I get bored and never finish them.
- **Skid Reverse Engineer:** Sometimes I reverse engineer stuff just for fun and to learn.
- **Kickboxing Enthusiast:** I like kickboxing (I have a yellow belt [7/11/2024])
- **Gaming Gamer:** I enjoy gaming and also using my coding skillz to have unfair advantage.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get inspired! Each project is a learning journey for me, and I hope they spark your curiosity too.
